Catherine: <Cathrine1> There are six gemstones scattered across various parts of the island. 
Catherine: <Cathrine1> Some are hidden near factories, others around the main village, and a few lie forgotten in desolate, abandoned areas.
Catherine: <Cathrine1> Collecting all six is the only way to activate the Stone Rune, the key to sealing the monster that terrorizes this land.

~ aboutMonster
Catherine: <Cathrine1> The roars of the monster... they're getting louder. It’s coming from the direction of the village. I can feel it—like the whole air is shaking. I don’t know how much more of this I can stand...
Catherine: <Cathrine1> Wait, listen to this—‘We villagers have always avoided matters like these. We hid away, pretended it wasn’t our problem.’
Catherine: <Cathrine1> Sounds like they thought the monster was just... someone else’s problem. But now… even they can’t ignore it. What happens when a place loses its safety...?
Catherine: <Cathrine1> The worst part? The monster isn’t just attacking. Its presence is crushing. I can feel it in my chest. If it’s true... the village isn’t safe anymore.
Catherine: <Cathrine1> . . . . **Pauses, deep in thought**
Catherine: <Cathrine1> I guess we’re all on our own now. But maybe… maybe there’s something more here. I’ll keep this, in case it helps.

~ aboutMonster2
Catherine: <Cathrine1> This one’s different... ‘If this is to be my final record, let it serve as a warning.’
Catherine: <Cathrine1> Wait, warning about what?
Catherine: <Cathrine1> ‘The monster’s power is tied to the island itself. As it rages, it grows stronger with each passing moment. There’s a way to stop it… but it’s dangerous.’
Catherine: <Cathrine1> I don’t know what this Stone Rune is, but it sounds important... Something about gemstones and placing them in the right spots.
Catherine: <Cathrine1> This guy knew it was coming for the island... and now I’m starting to wonder if it’s too late to stop it. Maybe that’s what the hunter meant when he talked about it.
Catherine: <Cathrine1> . . . . . **Looks around the abandoned house**
Catherine: <Cathrine1> I don’t have time to waste. If there’s a chance to stop this, I need to find Stone Rune and the gemstones. The island… it’s only a matter of time before it falls.
